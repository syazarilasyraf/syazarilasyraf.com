description: I recently had the pleasure to interview Pedro David Garcia Lopez, a Ruby and Rails developer based in UK, who used to be a Lorry driver. What's interesting is that he decided to become a developer at the age of 38. This post shares his story and I hope you find it as inspiring as I did!
