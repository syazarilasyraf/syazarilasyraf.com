Have you ever stumbled upon a personal website and thought, 'I want something like this'? That's the feeling I had when I discovered [Brian Lovin's website](https://brianlovin.com). It made me realize that a personal website can be more than just a digital presence; it can be a functional and unique platform. This led me to explore the idea of adding these sections to my own site.

# Making it Happen with Jekyll and Obsidian

To do this, I turned to Jekyll and Obsidian. Jekyll's simplicity and ability to structure content for personal projects drew me in. But what really won me over was Obsidian's seamless integration with Jekyll.

# The Dynamic Duo: Obsidian and Github Publisher

Getting started was a breeze. All it took was Obsidian and the ["Github Publisher" plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher). I jot down my notes, ideas, and recommendations in Obsidian, and the plugin handles the rest, publishing my content to my website with ease.

# Why I Made the Switch

It's all about keeping things simple. Google Keep is fantastic for basic notes, but when your collection grows, it can get messy. That's when I made the switch to Obsidian.

# The Appeal of Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is more than just a note-taking app. It values privacy, boasts a range of plugins, and offers local backups for peace of mind. It's user-friendly, making it a great choice for someone like me who's still learning the ropes.

In conclusion, adding a "Bookmarks" and "Tools" section to your personal website isn't just about content. It's a smart way to enhance your site's functionality and uniqueness. This approach sets your website apart and adds value to your visitors. Thanks to tools like Jekyll and Obsidian, it's a straightforward process. Obsidian, in particular, is a fantastic tool that enhances this journey.
