I wish I didn’t know AI existed. I wish AI didn’t exist at all.

I started learning to code, putting in the effort, taking courses, and trying to build things on my own. Then AI showed up. Suddenly, everything became so easy to create—but I wasn’t actually learning anything.

The problem isn’t that AI makes me stupid. It’s that AI makes me stop learning.

I used to be disciplined, going through tutorials and figuring things out step by step. Now, I just ask AI for the answer. Even this post? AI helped rewrite it, fixing my original messy notes into something readable. I skipped the hard parts—just like I do with coding now.

And that’s what scares me. If I’m always relying on AI, am I really becoming a web developer? Or am I just someone who knows how to ask AI the right questions?

I don’t know if I should still pursue this career path. Is there a solution? Should I push myself to learn without AI? Or should I just… ask AI for the answer again?
