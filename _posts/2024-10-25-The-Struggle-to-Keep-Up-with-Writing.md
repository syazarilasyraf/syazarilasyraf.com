It’s been a while since I wrote a new post. I’m supposed to be writing at least once a month and publishing here, but let’s be real—it’s not working out the way I planned.

Should I tell the internet the actual reasons? Maybe not. Let’s just say I’ve been *busy*.  

It’s my website. I get to decide what goes up here and when. If I don’t feel like posting, that’s okay. The world’s not going to end if there’s a gap between posts.

The pressure to stick to a schedule is real, but at the end of the day, this space is mine. So, I’ll keep writing when I feel like it and share when I’ve got something worth saying—or even just a cool link.

Because, honestly? That's enough.
