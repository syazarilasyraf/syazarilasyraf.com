It’s been a while since I wrote a new post. I’m supposed to be writing at least once a month and publishing here, but let’s be real—it’s not working out the way I planned.

Should I tell the internet the actual reasons? Maybe not. Let’s just say I’ve been *busy*.  

The thing is, I made a promise to myself: if I didn’t have any original post ideas, I’d at least publish something for the [links](https://syazarilasyraf.com/writing/#links) section. And honestly, that part's easy. I get Hacker News Digest from Brian Lovin daily, pick out a few interesting articles, and boom—a post is ready to go. Simple, right?

I’ve even written a little disclaimer on how I approach the Hacker News Digest part, over on my [bookmarks page](https://syazarilasyraf.com/bookmarks). It’s a mix of what catches my eye and what’s trending in the tech world. It doesn’t have to be groundbreaking stuff, just things that seem cool or relevant at the moment. So, if you’re ever curious about my selection process, you can check that out.

But enough about links. What I’m realizing is that pushing myself to churn out content just for the sake of it doesn't work. Creating something consistently and turning it into a habit is hard. It’s draining sometimes. And let’s face it, if I don’t write for a while, no one’s going to be upset.

It’s my website. I get to decide what goes up here and when. If I don’t feel like posting, that’s okay. The world’s not going to end if there’s a gap between posts.

The pressure to stick to a schedule is real, but at the end of the day, this space is mine. So, I’ll keep writing when I feel like it and share when I’ve got something worth saying—or even just a cool link.

Because, honestly? That's enough.
