Ever noticed how when you were a little kid, a school year felt super long, but now, time seems to sprint by?

Imagine your life like a bunch of boxes. Back when you were 5 and in kindergarten, one school year was a big chunk of your life. Fast forward to 22, and a year seems way tinier in comparison.

The catch is when you were a kid, everything was a new adventure, making your brain super busy. As you grow up, life gets more routine, and your brain doesn't make as many new memories anymore.

The simple solution is you just need to do exciting stuff! Bring back that feeling of doing things for the first time. Jump into thrilling experiences and make cool memories. Suddenly, time becomes more than just numbers on a calendar.
