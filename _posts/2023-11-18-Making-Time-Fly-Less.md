Ever noticed how when you were a little kid, a school year felt super long, but now, time seems to sprint by? Well, there's a reason for it, and there's a simple trick to slow it down a bit.

Imagine your life like a bunch of boxes. Back when you were 5 and in kindergarten, one school year was a big chunk of your life. Fast forward to 22, and a year seems way tinier in comparison.

But here's the catch: when you were a kid, everything was a new adventure, making your brain super busy. As you grow up, life gets more routine, and your brain doesn't make as many new memories.

So, here's the fun part â€“ to make time feel longer, do exciting stuff! Bring back that feeling of doing things for the first time. Jump into thrilling experiences, make cool memories, and suddenly, time becomes more than just numbers on a calendar.

In a nutshell, the secret to slowing down time is to add a dash of excitement. Break away from the usual routine, dive into adventures, and enjoy every moment. Because, in the end, what makes life rich isn't just the number of years but the awesome memories you create along the way.
