[Feynman's Garden](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_108_feynman_revisited/)・The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm, which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is “be smart”, but I disagree. The “algorithm” is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the context of hard problems where the answer can’t simply be looked up or trivially broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods. Feynman’s thinking algorithm is described like this:

[To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215)・MIT neuroscientists have found reading computer code does not rely on the regions of the brain involved in language processing.
