Ever had that pounding headache when choosing the right tech stack for your personal website? I sure did. After much contemplation, I settled on Jekyll. But truth be told, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to the "best" stack for a personal site. It all boils down to your goals and what you want to showcase.

When it comes to crafting your personal website, there are some key elements you can't afford to skip. The homepage is like your digital doorstep, your chance to give a glimpse of who you are. Consider a brief "about" section, showcase your key projects, add a subscription option, and pin your top posts. The structure of this page depends on how you want to present yourself initially.

The "About" section is crucial. It's where you tell your story, share your passions, and connect with your visitors on a personal level. The project section should proudly display your work, and a writing or blog section is great for sharing your thoughts and insights.

That's essentially all you need for a compelling personal website. But don't forget about the design. It's your first impression, and we all know first impressions matter. So, choose your design wisely; it's how people will judge you initially.
