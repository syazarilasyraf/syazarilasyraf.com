Everyone’s got something to say. Some of it’s gold hard-earned wisdom that could actually help you grow. But a lot of it? Just noise. Ego. People love the sound of their own insights, even when they’re not saying much.

The trick is learning to listen without worshipping. Be open. Don’t be so proud you ignore someone just because they don't look the part. But also, don’t be so naive you treat every opinion like gospel.

Listen. Filter. Keep what resonates. Toss what doesn’t.

Simple, but not easy.
