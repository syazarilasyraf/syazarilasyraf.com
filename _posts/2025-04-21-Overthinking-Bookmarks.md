For as long as I’ve been browsing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), I’ve had this habit of saving links. You know how it goes — you spot an interesting post, tell yourself you’ll read it properly later, and toss it into whatever system you’re using at the time. For me, that started with [Brian Lovin’s Daily Top Stories Newsletter](https://brianlovin.com/hn). Every day, I’d skim the links, pick the ones that caught my eye, and drop them into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — my personal note-taking app of choice.

At first, this worked fine. Obsidian is great for stashing thoughts and links, but the collection grew faster than I expected. Before long, it felt less like a helpful list and more like a digital junk drawer. That’s when I started tinkering. I built a little [personal bookmarks page](https://syazarilasyraf.com/bookmarks) — nothing fancy, just a static list on my site. But of course, once you have a page, you start obsessing over it: changing the theme, the layout, the way the links are grouped. The more I adjusted it, the less I actually used it.

Eventually, I thought: maybe I should treat these links more like a blog — post them as monthly collections, like my [Web Discoveries](https://syazarilasyraf.com/writing/#links) series. That felt smarter. But even then, the same problem came back: I was saving links for the sake of saving them, not actually revisiting them. The system was still broken, just dressed up differently.

So I tried to patch the bookmarks page again — this time adding features like a search bar, hoping it’d make the whole thing more useful. And for a short while, it did. I’d revisit the page, play around with it, but the excitement never lasted. The truth was pretty clear: I was spending more time building and tweaking the system than actually using it.

That’s when I stumbled on [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) — a self-hosted, open-source bookmarking tool. Minimalist, but packed with exactly what I needed: easy link saving, solid search, tags, notes, and even self-hosting under [my own domain](https://bookmark.syazarilasyraf.com/bookmarks/shared). No more reinventing the wheel. The moment I set it up, the stress around managing bookmarks just… stopped. For the first time, it actually felt like my bookmarks were useful — not just a pile of forgotten links.

So that’s how I ended up here. After all the hacks, tweaks, and dead-ends, it turns out the solution wasn’t to build another system, but to find one that was already built — and let it do its job.
