I'm Syazaril Asyraf, also known as Wan. I build things for the web and believe in using code to make the world a better place, one code at a time. Keeping things simple and minimal is my mantra.

<p class="section">Thoughts</p>
I write occasionally—sometimes just quick [notes](https://feed.syazarilasyraf.com), other times deeper explorations of topics that interest me. You’ll find them all [here](/writing).

<p class="section">Other</p>
I keep track of interesting [links](/bookmarks) I found, things I learn along the way, and [projects](/projects) I tinker with.
