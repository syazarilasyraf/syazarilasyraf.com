<h1>About me</h1>

Hey there, I go by ‘Wan.’ I made the shift from Electronic (Communication) Engineering to programming with a passion for making a positive impact, particularly in the dynamic world of technology trends and privacy. I focus on the impact and ethics of my work; trying to leave the world a better place than I found it.

By day, I'm an Electrical Technician in Göd, Hungary. At night, I'm just a guy enjoying all sorts of random things, tinkering with code and design-tools or explore minimalism.
