<h1>About me</h1>

Hi there, I'm Wan. I'm passionate about tech and its potential for good, especially in privacy and new trends. Transitioning to programming has been my way of fully immersing myself in that mission.

For me, it's not just about the jobâ€”it's about doing work that leaves a positive mark and stays true to my values. I'm on a mission to leave the world a bit better than I found it.

Beyond work hours, I'm a tech and design junkie. Whether I'm coding away, tinkering with design tools, or simplifying my life with minimalism, I'm always up for a creative challenge.
