Welcome to my personal site! This is where I share a bit about myself and what I'm up to on the internet.

## Overview

- **Writing**: Check out my writing, which includes some tech articles from my [Hashnode](https://wmsa.hashnode.dev/) days and explore my shorter, simpler posts on various topics like the web and personal development.
- **Projects**: Dive into my personal projects, along with some useful bookmarks and tools.

## Technologies

I've built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Console Theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console). It's all about minimalism and simplicity.

## Key Features

- **Bookmarks**: Discover my favorite internet findings, neatly organized.
- **Tools**: Access the tools I use regularly, directly from my site.

I've even written a post explaining how the bookmark and tool functionalities work [here](https://syazarilasyraf.com/personalizing-your-website).

Feel free to explore, comment, and reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat. 

## Future Plans

For now, I'm focused on writing more posts and keeping my bookmarks and tools up to date. Stay tuned for future updates!

Enjoy your visit!
